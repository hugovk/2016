Or is it a rubbish reference book? Just clock times:

> It's twelve pm and five seconds. Twelve pm and six seconds. Twelve pm and seven seconds. Twelve pm and eight seconds. It's twelve pm and nine seconds. The time is now twelve pm and ten seconds. Twelve pm and eleven seconds. It's twelve pm and twelve seconds. And thirteen seconds. Twelve pm and fourteen seconds. Twelve pm and fifteen seconds. It's twelve pm and sixteen seconds. It's twelve pm and seventeen seconds. And eighteen seconds. Twelve pm and nineteen seconds. Twelve pm and twenty seconds. Twelve pm and twenty-one seconds. And twenty-two seconds.
